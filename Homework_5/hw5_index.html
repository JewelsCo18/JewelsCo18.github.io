                        A noiseless patient spider,
                        <br>
                        I markâ€™d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,
                        <br>            
                        Markâ€™d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
                        <br>
                        It launchâ€™d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
                        <br>
                        Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And you O my soul where you stand,
                        <br>
                        Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
                        <br>
                        Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,
                        <br>
                        Till the bridge you will need be formâ€™d, till the ductile anchor hold,
                        <br>
                        Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.

                        A boisterous energetic spider,
                        <br>
                        I mark'd the journey from which it walks
                        <br>
                        Markâ€™d how to create a picture perfect surrounding,
                        <br>
                        You eagerly offer yourself, your secrets, your preferences,
                        <br>
                        Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly unleashing them. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And you O my soul where you stand,
                        <br>
                        Unwittingly bare for the world to see
                        <br>
                        Ceaselessly yearning, learning, connecting, seeking
                        <br>
                        Till the bridges you formâ€™d create a collective, no
                        <br>
                        Till the revolution strikes, no
                        <br>
                        Till the public roar quiets the echoes, O my patient soul.

                We are a society that thrives on connectivity, the pursuit of knowledge, passion. 
                We are a society that thrives as a collective and seek out those who align with our views.
                We are a society that is colorful yet black and white 
                The medium is the massage yes and we reflect the personality of those who live online
                But did the internet create the divide or humanity? 
                Did we instigate informatic wars? 
                Or did it come to fruition because it was accessible? 
                Who are we to blame for misinformation and the weaponization of words? 
                Who are we to blame for the catastrophes?
                Who can mend the broken trust, mental health, racism poisoning the world? 
                The medium is the message yes and it must reflect the world we desire
